Forked from [UrbanInstitute/rmarkdown-factsheets](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/rmarkdown-factsheets) to create the Children of Immigrants fact sheets, released February 2020. Creates 51 state-specific fact sheets and one slightly altered national level factsheet. Also outputs separate figures, annotated with title, source notes, and Urban logo, for distribution from all 51 fact sheets.
